Implement the Naive string matching algorithm and Rabin-Karp algorithm for string matching. 
Observe difference in working of both the algorithms for the same input.

Build a machine learning model that predicts the type of people who survived the Titanic 
shipwreck using passenger data (i.e. name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc.).

Using Machine learning algorithm on the famous Titanic Disaster Dataset for Predicting the survival of the passenger
                                                                    
The most famous competition over the kaggle . In this Repository my intention is to basically explain to every beginner but how to begin with Kaggle very first time. So this repository is for those who just begin their Machine Learning Journey. In this notebook i try to take down every single topic with a very naive approach so every beginner can grasp it very easily.

Dependencies:

    Python3
    Numpy
    Pandas
    Matplotlib
    Supervised Learning
    Machine Learning Algorithm
    Classification Algorithms
    
This Notebook will show basic examples of:

    Data Handling
    Importing Data with Pandas
    Cleaning Data
    Exploring Data through Visualizations with Matplotlib

Data Analysis:

Supervised Machine learning Techniques: + Logit Regression Model + Plotting results + Support Vector Machine (SVM) using 3 kernels + Basic Random Forest + Plotting results.

PS: Please do not forget to drop a star if you like it!
